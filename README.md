# inm-2024-memory-wall
This is a personal project aimed towards helping the Indonesian Students Association at UNSW (PPIA UNSW) by creating a personalized and custom memory wall to serve as an attraction within their public event.

This memory wall aims to provide participants of the Indonesian Night Market (INM) with an interactive art installation where they can interact with and place down their own personal mementoes in attending INM 2024.
